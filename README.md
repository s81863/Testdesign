# Test Design

This sample is based on the @googlemaps/js-samples located at
https://github.com/googlemaps/js-samples.
We modified it to display 8 static Street View Panoramas sequentially. Additionally a Map of type google-map is displayed as well.

## Setup

```sh
npm i
npm start  # development
npm run build  # production
```
